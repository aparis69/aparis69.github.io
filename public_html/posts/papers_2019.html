	<h2>Desertscapes, Implicit Terrains and Orometry papers</h2>
	September 30, 2019
	</div>
	<hr>
	I am happy to announce that three of our papers (two of which I am first author) have been accepted to major conferences in 2019. The first one is <b>
	<a class="aUnderlined" href="../projects/paris2019_Deserts.html">Desertscape Simulation</a></b> at Pacific Graphics, which will be presented in South Korea in October, 2019. 
	This work was done in early 2019 during my year as a research engineer in the Geomod team.
	<br><br>
	The second one is <b><a class="aUnderlined" href="../projects/paris2019_3D.html">Terrain Amplification using Implicit 3D Features</a></b> at ACM-TOG, which will be 
	presented at Siggraph Asia 2019 in Australia in November, 2019. This work was mostly done during my master's degree internship in early 2018 and then finished in late 2018 to be submitted to the ACM-TOG
	journal.
	For both of these paper, I will provide the presentation slides as well as the code to reproduce some of the results shown in the papers.<br><br>
	Finally, the <a class="aUnderlined" href="https://www.oargudo.com/research.html">Orometry paper</a> from <a class="aUnderlined" href="https://www.oargudo.com/">Oscar Argudo</a> as a first author was accepted 
	at Siggraph Asia 2019 and will also be presented in Brisbane.
